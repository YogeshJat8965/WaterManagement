# Water Supply Management System for Indore

## Overview

This project aims to enhance water supply management in Indore by installing smart IoT water meters in households. These meters will measure and transmit data on water flow and consumption to a centralized database. The data will be used to detect leakages through pressure differences and to visualize water usage across different wards via interactive charts. The goal is to provide actionable insights for government decision-making and efficient water resource management.
